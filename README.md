This tutorial will introduce different kinds of state management solutions existing in Flutter world. 

This is an attempt to, by applying all solutions to same app(in this case simple Counter APP), allow us to grasp the difference and pros/cons of each solutions. 

It will also tries to explain how similar solutions differs and identify other packages commonly used together with each solutions.
