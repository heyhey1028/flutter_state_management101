# MobX Counter
package: 
- [flutter_mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx) v2.0.2
- [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) v2.1.2
- [mobx_codegen](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx_codegen) v2.0.2

## memos
- a solution where codes are generated by annotating the corresponding properties
- Key concepts: `Observables`, `Actions` and `Reactions`

- Key annotations: `@observable`,`@action`,`@computed`
- `@computed`: getter method returning computed value of `@observable` field value. 
- class that holds State is called `store`
- In order for codes to be generated, we also need to install `build_runner` and `mobx_codegen` packages.
- codes are needed to be generated only in development, so add them in dev_dependencies. 

## Setting up
- because codes needs to be generated, we need to create a separated file for our state `store` 

## Accessing Data, Watching Data
- to watch: wrap widgets with `Obsever` widget by `flutter_mobx`
- to watch with extra functionality: mobx provides `reaction`,`autoran` and `when` methods
- `reaction`: can assign methods that will be run when observed value is mutated. 
- only reacts to when observed value is mutated to different value
```dart
reaction((_) => store.count, (count) => print(count));
```
- `autoran`: runs when any of the values used in the function is mutated.
- unlike `reaction`, it will run even if the observed value is mutated to same value.
```dart
autorun((_) => print(store.count));
```
- `when`: can assign a condition when to run the function. 
- function will only run once, even if the observed value meets the condition multiple times.
```dart
when((_) => store.count == 5, () => print('Count reach to 5'));
```
- to read: simply access the store variable for methods. 
```dart
onPressed: () => store.increment(),
```
